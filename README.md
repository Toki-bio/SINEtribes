SINEtribes clusters SINE sequences into high-identity groups ("tribes"), builds multiple sequence alignments, generates consensus sequences, and outputs BED tracks for genomic visualizationâ€”ideal for studying repetitive mobile DNA elements in comparative genomics.

Why: Automates tribe identification and consensus building for SINE analysis.
How: Run ./SINEtribes input.fasta (requires vsearch, MAFFT, EMBOSS cons, and seqkit).
